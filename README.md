# DyslexiaLearnFHE

**DyslexiaLearnFHE** is a **privacy-preserving personalized learning system** designed for children with **dyslexia**.  
By using **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, it allows the learning platform to analyze encrypted behavioral data ‚Äî such as reading speed, pronunciation attempts, and comprehension performance ‚Äî to tailor personalized learning exercises without ever accessing raw or identifiable information.

This project combines assistive technology, adaptive learning, and cryptographic privacy to ensure that **every learner receives customized support** while keeping their **educational and health data completely confidential**.

---

## Project Overview

Children with dyslexia often require highly individualized learning paths to make effective progress.  
However, traditional adaptive learning systems depend on **collecting and processing sensitive cognitive and behavioral data**, such as:

- Reading errors and patterns  
- Eye-tracking or focus metrics  
- Response latency and pronunciation attempts  
- Engagement and fatigue levels  

Such data, while useful for personalized instruction, can reveal **health conditions**, **learning disabilities**, and **psychological traits** ‚Äî all of which demand strict privacy protection, especially for minors.

**DyslexiaLearnFHE** addresses this challenge by applying **Fully Homomorphic Encryption** to perform adaptive analysis **directly on encrypted data**, enabling personalized feedback and learning recommendations **without ever decrypting sensitive information**.

---

## Motivation

The platform was built to solve three key issues in assistive education:

1. **Privacy Risks:** Sensitive behavioral and cognitive data can be misused if exposed.  
2. **Personalization Needs:** Each child‚Äôs learning pattern is unique and requires adaptive training.  
3. **Regulatory Barriers:** Privacy laws often limit how educational systems handle minors‚Äô data.

With FHE, **encrypted learning metrics can be processed safely**, allowing educators, researchers, and parents to benefit from AI-driven insights ‚Äî **without breaching confidentiality**.

## Why FHE Is Critical

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows mathematical operations to be performed on encrypted data **without decrypting it**.  
In the context of DyslexiaLearnFHE, this means:

- The system can **analyze encrypted reading performance**, **detect progress**, and **adjust exercises** automatically.  
- The platform never sees raw data ‚Äî only encrypted inputs and encrypted outputs.  
- Personalized recommendations are generated under encryption and only decrypted locally for the learner.

This workflow ensures that **data remains private at every stage** ‚Äî from collection to computation.

## Core Features

### üå± Personalized Learning under Encryption
Learner progress and error patterns are analyzed in ciphertext form.  
The system identifies improvement areas without exposing the underlying behavioral data.

### üß† FHE-Powered Adaptation Engine
The adaptive algorithm selects reading materials, phonetic exercises, and visual aids based on encrypted metrics like reading fluency and accuracy.

### üß© Cognitive Privacy Protection
All sensitive data ‚Äî including voice analysis, reading logs, and timing records ‚Äî remains encrypted during both transmission and computation.

### üóùÔ∏è Zero-Knowledge Progress Reporting
Parents and teachers receive progress summaries that are mathematically verifiable but contain no private learner data.

### üìö Curriculum Personalization
FHE-based clustering models identify similar learning trajectories across encrypted datasets, enabling curriculum optimization without data sharing between learners.

## Learning Flow

1. **Encrypted Data Collection**  
   The learner interacts with educational games, reading passages, and phonetic tasks.  
   Performance metrics are encrypted locally on the device.

2. **Homomorphic Processing**  
   The encrypted data is sent to the learning engine, which computes error rates, phoneme recognition patterns, and progress trends using FHE.

3. **Encrypted Feedback Generation**  
   The platform computes personalized lesson plans homomorphically.  
   The resulting encrypted recommendations are decrypted only on the child‚Äôs device.

4. **Adaptive Learning Loop**  
   The cycle repeats continuously ‚Äî ensuring real-time personalization while maintaining complete privacy.

  - Reading error detection  
  - Phoneme confusion tracking  
  - Pattern clustering  
  - Adaptive difficulty scoring  
- Uses FHE addition, multiplication, and comparison gates to evaluate performance metrics.

### 3. Feedback & Recommendation Layer

## Security & Privacy Framework

| Security Aspect | Implementation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Data Encryption | End-to-end FHE on all user-generated metrics |
| Computation Privacy | All analysis occurs on ciphertexts |
| Identity Protection | No learner identifiers are stored or transmitted |
| Access Control | Role-based decryption keys for educators and guardians |
| Regulatory Compliance | Designed for COPPA and GDPR-equivalent child data privacy standards |

### Threat Resistance
- No plaintext ever exists on the server.  
- Even if the computation node is compromised, attackers obtain only encrypted noise.  
- FHE guarantees data confidentiality through computation, removing the weakest trust point ‚Äî the processing server.

## Cognitive Analysis Under Encryption

The FHE engine performs several adaptive analysis tasks:

- **Error Pattern Recognition:** Detects common dyslexia-related reading errors homomorphically.  
- **Fluency Tracking:** Measures consistency of reading time under encryption.  
- **Engagement Estimation:** Analyzes encrypted attention metrics and interaction frequency.  
- **Difficulty Calibration:** Adjusts lesson complexity based on encrypted comprehension trends.

Each computation yields encrypted results that are decrypted only at the user‚Äôs end, keeping sensitive educational data confidential.

## Adaptive Model Highlights

- **Encrypted Clustering (FHE-KMeans):** Groups learners with similar encrypted behavioral patterns.  
- **Homomorphic Linear Regression:** Estimates reading speed progression over time.  
- **Privacy-Preserving Recommendation Network:** Suggests new exercises based on encrypted similarity vectors.  
- **Encrypted Federated Learning Option:** Allows multiple schools or therapy centers to collaborate without sharing any private data.

## Example Scenario

A child reads a short passage aloud on a tablet.  
The app encrypts every pronunciation metric and sends it to the cloud engine.  
The system homomorphically computes phoneme accuracy and reading fluency, identifying improvement needs.  
It then generates a new encrypted lesson plan focusing on letter reversal and pacing ‚Äî which the device decrypts locally for display.  

Throughout this process, **no one ‚Äî not teachers, developers, or cloud providers ‚Äî can see the raw learning data.**
